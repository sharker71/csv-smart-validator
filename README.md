        <p class="subtitle">CSV Smart Validator — Shopify App</p>
        <span class="badge">Last updated: February 2026</span>

        <h2>1. What We Do</h2>
        <p>CSV Smart Validator ("the App") helps Shopify merchants validate and fix CSV files before importing products into their store. The App is embedded within the Shopify Admin and operates as a tool for data quality assurance.</p>

        <h2>2. Data We Process</h2>
        <p>When you use the App, we process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CSV file contents</strong> — the file you upload for validation. This data is processed in memory on our servers and is never stored permanently. Files are discarded immediately after processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Shop domain</strong> — your Shopify store URL (e.g., your-store.myshopify.com), used to manage your subscription plan and usage limits.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription and usage data</strong> — your current plan (Free, Pro, or Business) and the number of validations performed in the current billing cycle.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect personal information about you or your customers.</li>
            <li>We do not access your Shopify store data, products, orders, or customer records.</li>
            <li>We do not use cookies or tracking technologies beyond what Shopify provides natively.</li>
            <li>We do not sell, share, or transfer any data to third parties.</li>
            <li>We do not store your CSV files. All processing happens in memory and data is discarded after the response is sent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How We Use Data</h2>
        <p>The data we process is used exclusively to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Validate your CSV file and generate a report of issues found.</li>
            <li>Apply automatic corrections and generate a fixed CSV for download.</li>
            <li>Manage your subscription plan and enforce usage limits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>CSV files are processed entirely in server memory and are never written to disk or stored in any database. Subscription data (shop domain, plan type, validation count) is stored in an encrypted database on our hosting infrastructure. All communication between your browser and our servers is encrypted via HTTPS.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App integrates with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shopify</strong> — for authentication, billing, and app embedding. Shopify's privacy policy applies to data they process: <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy" target="_blank">shopify.com/legal/privacy</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use any analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

        <h2>7. GDPR and Data Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not store personal data, most data subject requests do not apply. However, if you wish to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Delete your data</strong> — uninstalling the App will remove all subscription data associated with your store.</li>
            <li><strong>Request information</strong> — contact us and we will provide details of any data associated with your shop domain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. App Uninstallation</h2>
        <p>When you uninstall the App, all data associated with your store (subscription plan, usage counters) is deleted from our systems within 48 hours. Since we do not store CSV files, there is no file data to delete.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the App or via Shopify's notification system. The "Last updated" date at the top of this page indicates when this policy was last revised.</p>

        <h2>10. Contact</h2>
